# Poor Man's Twitter using VUE and Django
This simple coding assessment tests your full-stack skills with Vue and Django. Even if you are unfamiliar with Vue, the requirements are simple enough that you could complete it by browsing the Vue documentation.
## Requirements
Build a "Poor Man's Twitter" application in a single web page. The page consists of 2 pieces of functionality on the URL '/'.

The ability for any visitor to tweet. A tweet consists of a 50 character text input, a datetime that automatically records the time of a message and a name. Visible form fields for a tweet are the tweet and the name, which must be aligned horizontally to one another.
The ability to display all tweets (unpaginated) in a table . Show the time of the tweet, the message and the name. Sort the table using only the time and name columns.

The tweet form should appear at the top of the page. The tweets table should appear underneath the form. The process of adding a tweet must be asynchronous.

No login is required in order to tweet.
## Submission
Create a public repository on GitHub or GitLab. Please DELETE the ‘master’ or ‘main’ branch and push your code to a branch called ‘sample’. (this is to prevent google from indexing your project). 
Submit your repository’s link(s) by email to lmoore@accruvia.com.

## Technical requirements and stack
The following stack elements MUST be used EXCLUSIVELY. If an application or library is not listed, it cannot be used.

Django 3.0+ (backend)
Django Rest Framework
Vue
SQLite (Django default settings)

Do not use more libraries or software than are necessary to complete the project such as Docker. Although using Docker is a best practice (see below), you must not use any extra libraries or applications. This restriction protects your time by limiting your efforts to where we want to see them.

Assume the use of a modern browser (Firefox or Chrome).
Optional libraries
You may use Bootstrap if it speeds up your development time. Your use/lack of use of Bootstrap does not affect your evaluation.

We discourage the use of Npm / Yarn / Webpack in this project for the sake of your time. Remember, it is completely acceptable to include Vue directly in your single html document with a reference to a CDN or local file. We will not be evaluating your ability to use javascript packages and asset managers in this project. Only use package managers if it’s going to save you time.
How you will be evaluated
Demonstrate your genuine interest in the position by committing 2-4 hours to a screening project
Prove your knowledge of industry best practices without being explicitly directed as to what they are. That said, do not use any libraries or packages not listed in the Technical requirements
We value your time and do not want to encourage a culture of self-sacrifice for a project that will never be used in production. Do yourself a favor and submit the project as soon as you've met the requirements and implemented best practices across the project.
Additional information
If you are relatively competent in both Vue and Django, there is no reason this app should take you much longer than 2-4 hours. That is not a time restriction. It’s only an estimated time to completion.

The instructions above should be clear enough for you to complete the task without any additional information.

The Complete Hiring Process
Accruvia follows a 3 step hiring process. The company intends to make final offers no later than the end of business on Tuesday, November 1.

Complete this technical assessment. Grades are pass/mid/junior or fail. If you pass, you will be moved on to the next steps. We would like to receive your solution by the deadline mentioned above.
Interview #1
Interview #2

A final decision is made after step 3, at which point we start to gather salary requirements and rank applicants against Accruvia’s priorities and needs.
